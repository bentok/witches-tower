## Game Overview

### Philosophy: General

This game aims to be a simple physic's based puzzle platformer. I wish to create a physics-based game mechanic that works well and build all levels around that mechanic. Each level will get increasingly more sophisticated while building on the central mechanic. If the mechanic is solid and the levels are fun, this will allow for new levels to be added iteratively. 

The theme will be accessible by all ages, having a fantasy/fairy tale setting.

## Common Questions

### What is the game?

Witch's Tower is a physics-based co-op puzzle plaformer in which one player controls Repunzel while another player controls a prince. The core mechanic is that Repunzel can walk on platforms that are invisible to the prince. The prince must use Repunzel's hair to navigate the platforms which he cannot cross.

### Where does the game take place?

The game takes place in the tower from the fairy tale in which Repunzel is prisoner, however, the characters are descending through various puzzle rooms within the castle instead of through the window such as in the original story. 

### What do I control?

The playable characters in the game are Repunzel and the prince, from the fairy tale.

### How many characters do I control?

The game must be played by two players. One person controlling Repunzel and the other controlling the prince.

### What is the main focus?

The two characters are escaping from the tower and must work together to do so. They must descend the tower room-by-room.

### What is different?

Physics-based mechanic with which Repunsel must use her hair which the prince must grapple, swing, walk, etc.
