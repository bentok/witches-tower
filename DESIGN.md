## Game Overview

### Philosophy: General

This game aims to be a simple physic's based puzzle platformer. I wish to create a central physics-based game mechanic that works well and build all levels around that mechanic. Each level will get increasingly more sophisticated while building on the central mechanic. If the mechanic is solid and the levels are fun, this will allow for new levels to be added iteratively. 

The theme will be accessible by all ages, having a fantasy/fairy tale setting.
